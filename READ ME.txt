In order to use this program, you first need to allow root command to the machine, which can be done through your command/terminal window using ‘sudo -s’ . The password for this vm is 'z8Kb3CH%7vEqB9t$'. You then just type 'python3 distMeasurement.py' in order to run the program. The output should show when there are changes in the IP or port number between sending and receiving a packet, when a trace is being restarted or aborted, as well as how many times it has left until it is dropped, and lastly, the average amount of the original message is left in the response datagram across all of the traces. The timer on dropped packages is 60 seconds, and the program will try 4 times to receive a package before moving on.
